## UNDER CONTRUSTION
this repository isn't ready for use just yet, I will be writing documentation ASAP and cleaning up all code. If anyone thinks they will find this toolbox useful, send me a message any I'll get things done quicker :)


This repository holds a python tool box for the SUNRGBD dataset.

I made this toolbox box for personal use during an object dection project since I couldn't find any online, so I thought I'd share with anyone interested.
Feel free to use this code as you wish and raise any bugs via issue, or even better submit a pull request.
