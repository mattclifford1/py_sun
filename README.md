# py_sun

This repository holds a python tool box for the SUNRGBD dataset.

I made this toolbox box for personal use during an object dection project since I couldn't find any online, so I thought I'd share with anyone interested.
Feel free to use this code as you wish and raise any bugs via issue, or even better submit a pull request.

# Features of the Toolbox

Convert matlab metadata to a python friendly format

Easy extraction of ground truth labels

Point cloud generation from depth images using camera tilt, height and focal lengths

Visualisation of 2D and 3D bounding boxes

Class distribution visualasations 


more to come!!!
